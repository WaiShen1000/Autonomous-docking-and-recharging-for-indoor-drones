# Autonomous-docking-and-recharging-for-indoor-drones
This project aimed to develop a fully autonomous docking and charging solution for indoor drones to overcome the physical limitation of finite battery life. This system enables zero human interaction with drone operation, turning impossible applications become possible. 3D printing is adopted to build the charging and component dock. Contacting metal plates is our proposed solution to charge the drone without plugging the USB cable directly while electromagnet is to lock the metal plate. The hardware system is controlled by Arduino UNO and cooperates with a Python program for drone control. Tello SDK 2.0 is used in the Python program to control and communicate with the drone, the received image is processed by OpenCV for positioning and navigating. As a result, the program can navigate and land the drone in the dock, and the Arduino can start charging the drone.
